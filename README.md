# BHY2-Sensor-API
## Sensor-API Overview

This repository uses the combined Sensor-API (BHY2), which supports devices such as BHI260AP, BHI360, and BHI380. While Bosch Sensortec has restructured their Sensor-API into dedicated repositories, this project retains the unified approach for broader compatibility and ease of use.

For reference, the dedicated repositories are:

- [BHI2xy SensorAPI](https://github.com/boschsensortec/BHI2xy_SensorAPI.git)
- [BHI360 SensorAPI](https://github.com/boschsensortec/BHI360_SensorAPI.git)
- [BHI380 SensorAPI](No dedicated repository yet)

**Note:** If your development environment supports modern C++ standards, you may consider using the dedicated Sensor APIs for the latest updates. However, this combined approach ensures compatibility with a wider range of toolchains, including older environments like PlatformIO with the Espressif32 framework.
